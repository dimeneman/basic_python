 # HOW TO TAKE A INPUT ... GENERALLY FOR TAKING INPUT 
# WE USE "input()"" this code but for assigning some value we have
# to assign it with a variable 
# GENERALLY THE "input()" CODE IS FOR STRING VALUES BUT IF WE 
# WANT TO TAKE THEH INPUT AS INTEGER AND FLOAT WE HAVE TO WRITE DOWN THE DATATYPE NAME like----
# "int(input())"  &  "float(input())"

name = input("WHAT IS YOUR NAME ==>")
age = int(input ("HOW OLD ARE YOU ==>"))
height = float(input("HOW TALL ARE YOU ==>"))
 
                           # WE HAVE TO USE TYPECASTING 

print ( "Hello " + str(name) )      
print ( "you're " +str (age) + " years old" )
print ( "you're height is " + str( height) + " cm")
